Introduction
============

TamaGo is a framework that enables compilation and execution of unencumbered Go
applications on bare metal AMD64/ARM/RISC-V processors.

The [mx6ullevk](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago/tree/master/board/nxp/mx6ullevk)
package provides support for the [MCIMX6ULL-EVK](https://www.nxp.com/design/development-boards/i-mx-evaluation-and-development-boards/evaluation-kit-for-the-i-mx-6ull-and-6ulz-applications-processor:MCIMX6ULL-EVK) development board.

Documentation
=============

For more information about TamaGo see its
[repository](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago) and
[project wiki](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago/wiki).

For the underlying driver support for this board see package
[imx6ul](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago/tree/master/soc/nxp/imx6ul).

The package API documentation can be found on
[pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/usbarmory/tamago).

Compiling
=========

Go applications are simply required to import, the relevant board package to
ensure that hardware initialization and runtime support take place:

```golang
import (
	_ "github.com/usbarmory/tamago/board/nxp/mx6ullevk"
)
```

Build the [TamaGo compiler](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago-go)
(or use the [latest binary release](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago-go/releases/latest)):

```
wget https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago-go/archive/refs/tags/latest.zip
unzip latest.zip
cd tamago-go-latest/src && ./all.bash
cd ../bin && export TAMAGO=`pwd`/go
```

Go applications can be compiled as usual, using the compiler built in the
previous step, but with the addition of the following flags/variables and
ensuring that the required SoC and board packages are available in `GOPATH`:

```
GOOS=tamago GOARM=7 GOARCH=arm ${TAMAGO} build -ldflags "-T 0x80010000 -R 0x1000" main.go
```

An example application, targeting the MCIMX6ULL-EVK platform,
is [available](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago-example).

Executing and debugging
=======================

The [example application](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago-example)
provides reference usage and a Makefile target for automatic creation of an ELF
as well as `imx` image for flashing.

Native hardware: imx image over USB
-----------------------------------

Follow [the SDP procedure](https://github.com/usbarmory/usbarmory/wiki/Boot-Modes-(Mk-II)#serial-download-protocol-sdp)
using the built `imx` image.

Native hardware: imx image on microSD
-------------------------------------

Copy the built `imx` image to a microSD as follows:

```
sudo dd if=<path to imx file> of=/dev/sdX bs=1M conv=fsync
```
*IMPORTANT*: /dev/sdX must be replaced with your microSD device (not eventual
microSD partitions), ensure that you are specifying the correct one. Errors in
target specification will result in disk corruption.

Ensure the `SW601` boot switches on the processor board are set to microSD boot
mode:

| switch | position |
|--------|----------|
| 1      | OFF      |
| 2      | OFF      |
| 3      | ON       |
| 4      | OFF      |

Standard output
---------------

The standard output can be accessed through the debug console found
on micro USB connector J1901 and the following `picocom` configuration:

```
picocom -b 115200 -eb /dev/ttyUSB0 --imap lfcrlf
```

Debugging
---------

The application can be debugged with GDB over JTAG using `openocd` (version >
0.11.0) and the following `gdbinit` debugging helper:

```
target remote localhost:3333
set remote hardware-breakpoint-limit 6
set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit 4
```

Example:

```
# start openocd daemon
openocd -f interface/ftdi/jtagkey.cfg -f target/imx6ul.cfg -c "adapter speed 1000"

# connect to the OpenOCD command line
telnet localhost 4444

# debug with GDB
arm-none-eabi-gdb -x gdbinit example
```

Hardware breakpoints can be set in the usual way:

```
hb ecdsa.Verify
continue
```

QEMU
----

The target can be executed under emulation as follows:

```
qemu-system-arm \
	-machine mcimx6ul-evk -cpu cortex-a7 -m 512M \
	-nographic -monitor none -serial null -serial stdio \
	-kernel example -semihosting
```

The emulated target can be debugged with GDB by adding the `-S -s` flags to the
previous execution command, this will make qemu waiting for a GDB connection
that can be launched as follows:

```
arm-none-eabi-gdb -ex "target remote 127.0.0.1:1234" example
```

Breakpoints can be set in the usual way:

```
b ecdsa.Verify
continue
```
